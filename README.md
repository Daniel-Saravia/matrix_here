Technologies and Tools:

DE10-Standard Board
LED and 7-Segment Display: For visual feedback on seismic intensity and data.
LCD Display: For Marix display and user interaction.
Buttons: Allows users to interact with the system for commands.
verilog: Implements the digital logic on the 7-segment display and Possibly LED
C Programming Language: Utilized for developing embedded software, potentially for handling more complex data processing or interfacing tasks.
Quartus Prime: For verilog programming, offering tools for Pin Planning, simulation, and programming.
Visual Studio Code: Serves as the IDE for writing and managing C code.
FileZilla: to move files from laptop to board
Putty: To Start program on board
SoC EDS Command Shell: to cross complie code

The approach combines verilog for FPGA-based logic design with C programming for managing peripheral interactions. This dual-language strategy enhances flexibility in handling intricate system functionalities and user interactions.
